# Project of Algorithm and Data Structures

This a description about the project of Algorithm and Data Structures.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

First of all, you must have a Java environment. The project is based on JDK 1.7

This project does not use any libraries. All required data structures are included.

There are 3 package:

-  ManagementSystem: This package contains the main test code, and the implementations of the project's methods.
- LibraryClass: This package contains classes of the library, such as Clients and Publications.
- DataStructure: This package contains all data structures that needed for the project.

### Running the tests

If you want to execute the project, you can open the LibraryTest.java in package ManagementSystem. LibraryTest.java provides tests for all methods of LibraryManagementSystem.java.

In other classes, there are also code for testing, I commented them all out. If you want to test a class in isolation, you can use them.
